gnuplot (4.6.5-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  /usr/bin/gnuplot binary is managed now through update-alternatives
  mechanism and depends on installed gnuplot configuration
  (-nox, -x11 or -qt).

  gnuplot version 4 provides also /usr/bin/gnuplot4 symlink. 
  It points on installed gnuplot binary variant (-nox, -x11 or -qt).

  To be sure you are using gnuplot of version 4 please type
  gnuplot4 in command line.

  These changes are needed due to a new gnuplot major version 5 and
  allows one to install both versions simultaneously.

gnuplot (4.6.5-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  We stop to provide wxt-terminal because wxwidgets 3.0 is not compatible
  with gnuplot [1], [2]. wxt-terminal will be enabled again if the bug
  will be fixed.
